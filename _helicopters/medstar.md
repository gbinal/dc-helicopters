### Viewing Tips 

It's very common to see these helicopters flying to and from the Washington Hospital Center, in particular to and from the Southeast.  

### Notable Incidents 

I've only come across one instance of a helicopter crash in DC so far, and it was a [2006 crash](https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/Update_on_NTSB_Investigation_of_EMS_Helicopter_Crash_in_Washington_DC.aspx) of a MedSTAR helicopter near the hospital.
