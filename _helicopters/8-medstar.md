It's very common to see these helicopters flying to and from the Washington Hospital Center in the middle of the district.  

### Notable Incidents 

I've only come across one instance of a helicopter crash in DC so far, and it was a [2006 crash](https://www.hmpgloballearningnetwork.com/site/emsworld/news/10340453/helicopter-approached-twice-dc-crash) of a MedSTAR helicopter near the hospital.
