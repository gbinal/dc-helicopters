### Aircraft Type

### Viewing Tips 

If you see a helicopter over DC at night with a spotlight shining down, it's almost certainly this one.  Similarly, if you see a helicopter loitering in a tight circle over one spot, it's often either this one or - if you're downtown or by the mall - the [Park Police helicopter](https://helicoptersofdc.com/helicopters/us-park-police-aviation-unit/).
