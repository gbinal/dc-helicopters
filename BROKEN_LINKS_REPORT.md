4. **Service No Longer Available:**
   - Multiple domains appear to be no longer active or have changed

### Network Blocked Links (May Work in Normal Environment)

These 38 links are blocked in our sandboxed environment but may work normally:

- `travis-ci.org` links (2 instances) - TravisCI links
- `creativecommons.org` links (2 instances) - Creative Commons license links  
- `helicoptersofdc.com` links (15 instances) - The main project website
- `map.copterspotter.com` links (3 instances) - CopterSpotter mapping service
- `xkcd.com` links (1 instance) - XKCD comic reference
- `googletagmanager.com` links (1 instance) - Google Analytics
- And others...

### Working Links

12 links were successfully verified as working, primarily GitHub URLs and some external resources.

## Recommended Actions

### High Priority (Fix Immediately)

1. **Fix malformed URLs:**
   - Line 23 in index.md: Fix double slash in Flickr URL
   - Line 35 in us-park-police-aviation-unit.md: Add missing closing parenthesis

2. **Update 404 URLs:**
   - Research and update all URLs returning 404 errors
   - Consider using archived versions from web.archive.org if original sources are no longer available

3. **Fix 403 Forbidden:**
   - Update CFPB source code policy URL to current location

### Medium Priority

1. **Verify TravisCI links:** Update to GitHub Actions if migration occurred
2. **Check helicoptersofdc.com status:** Verify if this is the intended domain and if it's active
3. **Update Creative Commons links:** Ensure they point to current CC license URLs

### Low Priority

1. **Verify CopterSpotter links:** Check if service is still active
2. **Review Google Analytics setup:** Verify tracking configuration

## Technical Notes

- This analysis was performed in a sandboxed environment with restricted internet access
- Network blocked links may actually be functional in normal environments
- Some services may have temporary outages that could affect results
- Regular link checking should be implemented as part of CI/CD pipeline

## Next Steps

1. Review and fix the truly broken links identified above
2. Test network blocked links in a normal environment to verify their status
3. Consider implementing automated link checking in the repository's CI/CD pipeline
4. Update documentation with corrected URLs
