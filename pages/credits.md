* My greatest inspiration in this project is those who've already made a pass as distilling information about the helicopters that fly over DC: 
  * [Foxtrot Alpha - These Elite Military Helicopter Units Fly Washington's Power Players](https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/these-elite-military-helicopter-units-fly-washingtons-p-1704260996)
  * [celocanth13's Reddit post - A non-exhaustive guide to the helicopters of DC](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/8u3erg/a_nonexhaustive_guide_to_the_helicopters_of_dc/)
* The wonderful people who contribute to and help maintain Wikipedia.  Consider signing up for a modest monthly recurring donation if you haven't already!  It'll support a great resource and let you gloss over those fundraising asks guilt-free from now on!  :). 
* Randall Munroe for inspiring the earnest enjoyment of neat things.  
* Ben Balter for getting me and thousands of others onto GitHub and into open source.  He's a gracious and fun teacher, and I'm grateful for all he does.  He also planted the seed for this project when he sent me [this article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/marcambinder/secret-armies-an-exclusive-look-at-10-secret-us) 5-6 years ago.  
* The technologists at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for all of their good work, which includes a bunch of great open source code.  This website is based off of the [Open Source Program Template](https://github.com/virtix/open-source-program-template/) that Bill Shelton and his teammates worked on.  They are a model for all of government.
