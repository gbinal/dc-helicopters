Here we'll collect information on helicopters who occasionally fly over DC, but aren't a regular presence.  

## Marine One Preparation Testing

* Aircraft Type: [Sikorsky S-92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-92)
* FAA Registry Number: [N948PH](https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N948PH)
* Details: A sharp-eyed Washingtonian [wrote up](https://medium.com/@DaveStroup/solving-the-mystery-of-the-big-yellow-helicopter-756eba187585) noticed a yellow Sikorsky S-92 flying over DC in the summer of 2018 flying over DC.  After some research, he intelligently deduced that it is being field testing in anticipation of it's upcoming responsibility as the Marine One.  

## National Nuclear Security Administration - Aerial Measuring System

* Aircraft Type: [Bell 412](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_412)
* Details: In 2012-2013, a Department of Energy helicopter operated by the [National Nuclear Security Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Nuclear_Security_Administration) flew a systematic grid over Washington DC to detect the background radiation in order to establish a baseline that could be compared against in time of emergency.  The program is known as the Aerial Measuring System.  I recalled seeing it from my office at the time, flying very low and in a tight grid.  The testing flights [continue to take place](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+U.S.+Department+of+Energy%E2%80%99s+National+Nuclear+Security+Administration+(DOE%2FNNSA)+will+conduct+low-altitude+helicopter+flights%22+site%3Aenergy.gov) in various US cities and may recur in DC at some point.

## Fairfax County Police

* Aircraft Type: [Bell 429 GlobalRanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_429_GlobalRanger)
* FAA Registry Number: [N211FX](https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N211FX)
* Details: I've only seen this once over DC, but I would guess that it might come to DC on occasion for medevac reasons.  

## Maryland State Police

* Aircraft Type: [AgustaWestland AW139](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgustaWestland_AW139)
* FAA Registry Number: [TRP2](https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=TRP2), [TRP17](https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=TRP17), and others.
* Details: I see some of these from the Maryland State Police over DC rarely.  I would guess that it might come to DC on occasion for medevac reasons.
